# Attendance-System-using-Face-Mask-Recognition
Developed an attendance system that would mark the attendance of a person with the help of the attendeeâ€™s face and record the attendance details in a .csv file. The successful implementation of the project would mark the attendance and also record information such as name of the attendee along with time and date of marking of attendance.
